Not recommended for native speakers of the English language.
When trees == forests and top-level directories are instead 'naming contexts' .... The desirable format would be "This feature, which MS call 'X', is 'Y' plain english", but instead the Y feature will only ever be called X. 
This is not a helpful book

If I had been an editor and received "Deadly Slipper",
I would have said the following:

"Dear Ms. Wan,

Your book is unacceptable for the following reasons:

1) The Setting.  One hazard of writing about the place
where you spend your summers is that you end up
writing through the eyes of a visitor rather than a
native.  Dordogne sounds delightful,and I'd certainly
like to visit it based on your descriptions of
delightful pigeon coops and sheep scattered across the
landscape, but it is disturbing that you have
cicadas singing in May.  It suggests you are only
familiar with the setting during the vacation months
when you habitually visit. To really describe a place,
I think you need to know it better.

2) The characters.  Because you spend your summers in
Dordogne, you appear to know only other wealthy
foreigners.  All your main characters are expatriates
with irritatingly bourgeois occupations.  I don't know
if you realize that all the native-born French
characters you portray are ugly, boorish, sexually
depraved, mentally defective, criminal, or terminally
quaint, and they all appear to make cheese.  Surely
this isn't a realistic portrayal of the French.

3) The Orchids.  Actually, the orchids are fine, but
the idea that orchid fanciers are maniacal and
possibly homicidal is a questionable one; most orchid
fanciers are fairly tedious.  Also, the idea that a lady
slipper mutant would spontaneously occur and allow the
orchid to live outside its native habitat is idiotic. 
Anyone would tell you that a hybrid is a better bet.

4) The Dogs.  One cute dog is sufficient; two are too
much.  Puppies are inexcusable.

5) The Romance.  Most mystery writer are aware of the
hazard of including a romance in a mystery, but you
walked in innocently, unaware that your two characters
are unpleasant, self-involved and have no chemistry
(and that's not even mentioning their unspeakable
dogs).  You set a big obstacle in their path by having
one think the other is a deranged serial killer; a
great writer might be able to pull this off, but you
can't. 

6) Trendoid aspects.  Epistolary novels are *so* 18th
century.  But having a NY psychiatrist profile the
serial killer by email is so LAST WEEK.  You will be
sorry you did this, sooner rather than later.  

7) The Ending.  Ridiculous and melodramatic.  Georges Simenon wrote about crime with great psychological acuity.  You should read one of his books.

This book is very disappointing. The writing is terrible and rather amateurish. The writer bored me, maybe something's lost in translation from French, I don't know.  I already knew the killer the first time he was introduced in the book, although the writer tried to create red herrings which did not work. Mara sounds stupid, immature and inconsistent. Skip this book, it's not worth your time. Peter Mayle's mysteries set in France are way much better that this. At least his novels have sense of humor, suspense, very interesting characters and most important, they are very well written

I was extremely disappointed by this book/pamphlet, being misled by the other favorable reviews.  It is completely lacking in information.  It has 51 6"x8" pages with huge font and too many cartoons.  It successfully defines what is good and bad posture, but does not provide excercises to improve it (it simply states to "practice" good posture).  There are much much better alternatives.  I have read "Posture Alignment" and recommend that, and have heard of great reviews for "Posture, Get It Straight!"

This book is the typical package of business ideas.  The book gets 2 stars because the few pages devoted to entrepreneurship has very little substance and the information under each idea is sparse and in many cases not helpful.  In addition, there are numerous ideas that require a tremendous amount of work.  The author does state that what may be work for one person, may be play to another.  However, this relates to doing something you enjoy or having a passion where you don't mind putting in the time or work.  The title suggests that the business ideas listed in the book will not require a great deal of time or effort, which is not the case for many of the ideas(Masonry, Restauranteur for example).

This book has some value for those that have not read similar books of this type.  Otherwise, I would take a pass on this one

And you shouldn't inhale.
Several reviewers have ecstatically proclaimed this book and movie to be an eye-opening, truth-revealing work, but those who are credulous enough to think they learn history through agenda-focused books and films like "Hunting" need to go back and see other "documentaries" like "Triumph Of The Will", "The Eternal Jew" or "Reefer Madness".
Let's be honest, people. 
This book was written by a strongly pro-Clinton columnist and the movie was produced by well-known FOB (Friend Of Bill) Harry Thompson.  It's about as objective as the factually challenged "Fahrenheit 9/11", a work that Moore himself now calls "satire".  (By the way, I'll bet you didn't know that many Middle Easterners who have seen Moore's movie are outraged at the shallow, stereotypical and racist image he presented of their people and culture.)  
The point is, whether intentional or just laziness these dime-a-dozen political books typically contain significant misrepresentations.  If you're already a member of the author's congregation, you won't care.  You'll shout "hallelujah!" and say that "Hunting" has given the world Great Truths.  But clear thinkers understand that it's foolish to uncritically accept the representations in either this book or the followup movie.
